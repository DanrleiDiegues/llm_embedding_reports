Fraud,"This report, jointly prepared by the EBA and the ECB, assesses the latest payment data reported to the EBA and the ECB under Article 96(6) of Directive EU 2015/2366 (the revised Payment Services Directive, PSD2). It covers semi-annual data reported for the three reference periods H1 2022, H2 2022 and H1 2023, and focuses on the payment instruments of credit transfers, direct debits, card payments (from an EU/EEA issuing perspective), cash withdrawals and e-money transactions. The data covers all EU/EEA countries that reported the full time series and the report analyses total payment transactions and the subset of fraudulent transactions, both in value and volume terms. It further provides more detailed analyses on specific topics such as the main fraud types and the application of strong customer authentication (SCA), as well as some geographical and country-level analyses. The report assesses the payment fraud reported by the industry across the European Economic Area (EEA), which amounted to EUR 4.3 billion in the year 2022 and EUR 2.0 billion in the first half of 2023. Most payment fraud in value terms was related to credit transfers and card payments, across all three reference periods analysed. More specifically, in the period H1 2023 the total value of fraudulent credit transfers sent by PSPs in the EU/EEA amounted to EUR 1.131 billion, and the value of card fraud using cards issued in the EU/EEA amounted to EUR 633 million. In volume terms, 7.31 million card transactions using cards issued in the EU/EEA in H1 2023 were fraudulent, while the number of fraudulent credit transfers, direct debits, cash withdrawals and e-money transactions was significantly lower. In relative terms, the highest fraud rates were observed for card payments, where fraud accounted for 0.031% of total card payments in value and 0.015% of total card payments in volume terms in H1 2023, as well as for e-money transactions (0.022% of the total value and 0.012% of the total number of emoney payments). Fraud rates were substantially lower for all other instruments, with the exception of direct debit fraud in volume terms (accounting for 0.014% of the number of direct debit transactions in H1 2023). Card fraud predominantly occurred for remote transactions, while the majority of overall card payments were conducted non-remotely. By contrast, credit transfers and e-money transactions were mostly initiated remotely, both with regard to overall transactions and fraudulent ones. Card payment fraud seemed to predominantly occur with fraudulent payment orders issued by the fraudster, with the specific reasons mostly being the use of lost or stolen cards in the case of nonremote card fraud (more than 50% in terms of volumes in H1 2023) and card details theft in the case of remotely conducted card fraud (64% in volumes in H1 2023). By contrast, counterfeit card fraud and manipulations of the payer to initiate a payment order played only a minor role across the three reporting periods. Manipulations of the payer accounted for more than half of the total value of fraudulent credit transfers during this time. SCA was applied for the majority of electronic payments in value terms, especially for credit transfers (around 77%). In general, SCA-authenticated transactions showed lower fraud rates than non-SCA transactions, especially for card payments. Furthermore, fraud rates for card payments turned out to be significantly (about ten times) higher when the counterpart is located outside the EEA, where the application of SCA may not be requested. The use of the exemptions to SCA that are offered in the technical standards developed by the EBA and the ECB varied by payment instrument and initiation channel. Some exemptions, such as the low value exemption, trusted beneficiaries, recurring transactions or transaction types that are outside the scope of SCA requirements under PSD2 showed higher fraud rates than others, such as transactions involving secure corporate processes and protocols. The findings support a beneficial impact of SCA requirements introduced under PSD2 on the security of electronic payments, but also highlight the need for further investigations regarding the correct application of these requirements by the market. Losses due to frauds were distributed differently among liability bearers depending on the payment instrument. In H1 2023, payment service users (PSUs) bore 45% and 51% of the losses that arose from card payments and cash withdrawals, respectively; this share was below 25% for e-money transactions. In contrast, PSUs endured more than 80% of total fraud losses for credit transfers. However, the distribution of the liability for fraud losses between PSUs and PSPs diverged significantly across countries: in the specific case of card payments, in a significant number of countries PSUs bore more than half of the fraud losses, at times as much as 80% of all losses or more, while in some other countries the share was as low as 30% or less. Regarding the geographical dimension of fraud, the presented results show that, while most payment transactions were domestic, most card payment fraud (71% in value terms in H1 2023) and a large share of credit transfer and direct debit fraud (43% and 47%, respectively, in H1 2023) were crossborder. A notable share of fraudulent card payments (28% in H1 2023) was thereby related to crossborder transactions outside the EEA. Looking ahead, the general outlook with respect to overall payment fraud based on the presented analysis appears stable. The widespread adoption of the RTS for SCA and CSC has had a positive effect on reducing fraudulent payments, especially for transactions conducted within the EEA. Additionally, industry measures such as the global implementation of the EMV standard also continued to limit the opportunities to conduct fraud, e.g. with regard to the use of counterfeit cards. Nevertheless, it is important for the industry, regulators and consumers to remain alert. Both the EBA and the ECB will continue to closely monitor developments in payment fraud, using the valuable data collected under PSD2 and the ECB Regulation on payments statistics.

The total value of fraudulent transactions reported by the industry across the European Economic Area (EEA) amounted to EUR 4.3 billion in 2022 and EUR 2.0 billion in the first half of 2023. This considers the sum of all fraudulent transactions reported for credit transfers, direct debits, card payments, cash withdrawals and e-money transactions5 (as per Chart 1a). The highest fraud values between H1 2022 and H1 2023 were reported in credit transfers and card payments. In the first half of 2023, the total value of fraudulent credit transfers sent from PSPs in the EU/EEA and received worldwide amounted to EUR 1.131 billion (see Chart 1a), which was 14% lower compared with the first half of 2022. Card fraud using cards issued in the EU/EEA amounted to EUR 633 million in the first half of 2023, with fraud values remaining fairly stable over the three reporting periods. In comparison, the value of total fraudulent card payments acquired by EU/EEA PSPs (not shown) was higher, amounting to EUR 826 million in the first half of 2023. In contrast, the value of fraudulent direct debits, cash withdrawals and e-money transactions in absolute terms remained at more moderate levels (i.e. below EUR 100 million in the first half of 2023 in each case). In relative terms, fraud rates (i.e. fraud as a share of the total value of transactions) remained at low and stable levels for credit transfers, direct debits and cash withdrawals. The vast majority of the value of overall electronic payment transactions was related to credit transfers (amounting to more than EUR 141 trillion in the first half of 2023). As a result, the fraud rate for this in value termsremained relatively low in comparison, i.e. at 0.001%6 for the three reference periods between H1 2022 and H1 2023. Fraud ratesfor direct debits and cash withdrawals were on similar levels albeit slightly higher, at 0.002% and 0.008%, respectively.

The total value of fraudulent transactions reported by the industry across the European Economic Area (EEA) amounted to EUR 4.3 billion in 2022 and EUR 2.0 billion in the first half of 2023. This considers the sum of all fraudulent transactions reported for credit transfers, direct debits, card payments, cash withdrawals and e-money transactions5 (as per Chart 1a). The highest fraud values between H1 2022 and H1 2023 were reported in credit transfers and card payments. In the first half of 2023, the total value of fraudulent credit transfers sent from PSPs in the EU/EEA and received worldwide amounted to EUR 1.131 billion (see Chart 1a), which was 14% lower compared with the first half of 2022. Card fraud using cards issued in the EU/EEA amounted to EUR 633 million in the first half of 2023, with fraud values remaining fairly stable over the three reporting periods. In comparison, the value of total fraudulent card payments acquired by EU/EEA PSPs (not shown) was higher, amounting to EUR 826 million in the first half of 2023. In contrast, the value of fraudulent direct debits, cash withdrawals and e-money transactions in absolute terms remained at more moderate levels (i.e. below EUR 100 million in the first half of 2023 in each case). In relative terms, fraud rates (i.e. fraud as a share of the total value of transactions) remained at low and stable levels for credit transfers, direct debits and cash withdrawals. The vast majority of the value of overall electronic payment transactions was related to credit transfers (amounting to more than EUR 141 trillion in the first half of 2023). As a result, the fraud rate for this in value termsremained relatively low in comparison, i.e. at 0.001%6 for the three reference periods between H1 2022 and H1 2023. Fraud ratesfor direct debits and cash withdrawals were on similar levels albeit slightly higher, at 0.002% and 0.008%, respectively.

In contrast, fraud rates appear noticeably higher for card payments and e-money transactions. For the former, the value of fraud as a share of the total value of card payments using cards issued in the EU/EEA slightly increased over the three reporting periods, from 0.026% in H1 2022 to 0.031% in H1 2023. The increased fraud rate for card payments in the last two reference periods compared with the first half of 2022 is the result of a decline in overall card payments of -12% year on year in H1 2023 that coincided with an increase in the value of card fraud per se of +4% year on year in the same period. For e-money transactions, the corresponding fraud rate in the first half of 2023 was at 0.022%, which is significantly lower than in the previous two reference periods. Chart 1b: Absolute and relative levels of fraud by type of payment instrument (in volumes) (left axis: total volume of fraud (millions of transactions); right axis: fraud as a share of the total volume of transactions of that type) Turning to volumes, card payment fraud accounted for by far the largest number of fraudulent transactions between H1 2022 and H1 2023. The high number of fraudulent transactions in comparison to other instruments mirrors the fact that card payments account for the majority of electronic payments in volume terms. In H1 2023, the number of total card payments with cards issued in the EU/EEA amounted to around 48.77 billion transactions, out of which around 7.31 million transactions were fraudulent (see Chart 1b). In relative terms, card fraud volumes accounted for 0.015% of the total number of card payments in H1 2023, which marked a slight year on year decline from 0.017% in H1 2022. Overall, fraud rates for card payments in terms of volumes remained considerably below the corresponding figures for values in all three reporting periods that were analysed. The fraud rate for direct debits in volume terms was noticeably higher than the corresponding fraud rate in value terms across all reference periods. Overall, around 1.50 million direct debit transactions were reported as fraudulent for the EU/EEA in H1 2023, which accounted for around 0.014% of the total number of direct debits during this period. The fraud rate of direct debit payments thereby increased over the three reference periods, from 0.010% in H1 2022 to 0.011% in H2 2022 and 0.014% in H1 2023.

Fraud rates for e-money transactions in volume terms were on similar levels to those for card payments and direct debits. The volume of fraudulent e-money transactions amounted to around 540 000 transactions in H1 2023. In a similar way to card payments, the fraud rate for e-money 0.003% 0.002% 0.003% 0.010% 0.011% 0.014% 0.017% 0.016% 0.015% 0.004% 0.005% 0.005% 0.016% 0.015% 0.012% 0.000% 0.004% 0.008% 0.012% 0.016% 0.020% 0 2 4 6 8 10 H1 '22 H2 '22 H1 '23 H1 '22 H2 '22 H1 '23 H1 '22 H2 '22 H1 '23 H1 '22 H2 '22 H1 '23 H1 '22 H2 '22 H1 '23 Credit transfers Direct debit Card payments (issuer) Cash withdrawals E-money Domestic Cross-border within EEA Cross-border outside EEA Fraud rate Page 12 of 35 transactions in volume terms declined over the three reporting periods (from 0.016% in H1 2022 to 0.012% in H1 2023). The reported volumes of fraudulent credit transfers and cash withdrawals were low both in absolute and relative terms. Whereas credit transfers accounted for a large share of total electronic transactions and fraud in value terms, they played a less significant role in terms of volumes. The total number of credit transfers sent from PSPs in the EU/EEA in H1 2023 amounted to 21.81 billion transactions, of which around 616 000 transactions were fraudulent. Consequently, the corresponding fraud rate for credit transfers in H1 2023 was at 0.003% (i.e. unchanged compared with H1 2022). The number of fraudulent cash withdrawals in H1 2023 amounted to around 174 000 transactions. Compared with a total number of 3.57 billion cash withdrawals during the same period, the corresponding fraud rate was at 0.005% (remaining fairly stable from previous reference periods). The average value of a fraudulent transaction appeared highest for credit transfers compared with other payment instruments. In H1 2023, the average fraudulent credit transfer amounted to EUR 1 835, which however was substantially lower than the average value of a credit transfer in general (at EUR 6 485 in H1 2023; see Chart 2). In comparison, the average fraudulent cash withdrawal and e-money payment amounted to EUR 358 and EUR 98 in H1 2023, respectively. The average fraudulent card payment and direct debit transaction was even lower, at EUR 87 and EUR 65, respectively. This is not surprising, because credit transfers are the preferred instrument for high-value transactions, while direct debits and card payments are often used for lower-value retail payments in shops or for e-commerce. The observed average values related to fraudulent card payments, cash withdrawals and e-money transactions were higher than the average overall transaction value for these instruments. In contrast, the average fraudulent credit transfer or direct debit transaction was lower than the corresponding average transaction value for these instruments in general."
Fraud,"3.1 Remote versus non-remote transactions and fraud Electronically initiated credit transfers are almost exclusively initiated remotely, both with regard to overall transactions and fraud. Around 98% of the total value of electronically initiated credit transfers and 99% of the value of corresponding credit transfer fraud, in each of the three reference periods analysed, related to payment transactions that were initiated remotely, i.e. via the internet or through a device that can be used for distance communication (see Charts 3a and 3b). The same overall trends are observed for volumes (see Charts 4a and 4b).

While the majority of card payment transactions were initiated non-remotely, card fraud was predominantly related to remotely initiated payments. Remote card payment fraud accounted for 82% of the value of card fraud in H1 2023 (80% in volume terms). In contrast, remotely initiated payments accounted for only around 24% of the total value of overall card transactions in H1 2023; the corresponding share in volume terms was even lower (17%). In consequence, the relative fraud rate in H1 2023 was substantially higher for remote (0.101% in values; 0.068% in volumes) compared with non-remote payments (0.007% in values; 0.004% in volumes). This trend was observed across all three reference periods analysed. In a similar way to credit transfers, e-money transactions were mostly initiated remotely. Close to 90% of the total value of e-money transactions related to remotely initiated transactions (i.e. payment transactions initiated via the internet or through a device that can be used for distance communication) in each of the three periods analysed (around 80% in volume terms). In terms of fraud, 97% of all e-money fraud in H1 2023 in terms of value was initiated remotely (95% in volume terms)."
Fraud,"3.2 Fraud types by payment instrument Fraud in card payments, cash withdrawals and e-money transactions was almost exclusively due to the issuance of payment orders by the fraudster. In each of the three reference periods analysed, more than 92% of the total value and around 98% of the total volume of card fraud was related to this type (see Charts 5 and 6). A more detailed analysis of underlying fraud types for this category of card payment fraud is provided below. In a similar way to card fraud, more than 95% of fraudulent cash withdrawals and e-money transactions in both value and volume terms were initiated by the fraudster. Manipulation of the payer to initiate a fraudulent transaction and modification of a payment order by the fraudster appeared to only play a very limited role with respect to card payments, cash withdrawals and e-money fraud. By contrast, for credit transfers a large share of fraudulent transactions was due to the manipulation of the payer to initiate a transaction. This type of fraud accounted for 57% of the total value of credit transfer fraud in H1 2023 (see Chart 5). In terms of volumes, the issuance of a payment order by the fraudster still appeared to be the more frequent type, accounting for close to 70% of fraudulent credit transfers in H1 2023 (see Chart 6).

Finally, most cases of direct debit fraud were accounted for by unauthorised8 payment transactions. More than 99% of all fraudulent direct debits in both volume and value terms were related to this type of fraud in H1 2023. While this percentage was also observed for both H1 and H2 2022 for the number of fraudulent direct debits, some more notable shares were observed with regard to the manipulation of the payer in value terms (i.e. 14% and 5% of the total value of direct debit fraud in H1 and H2 2022, respectively).

Around two-thirds of remote card fraud is due to card details theft. The collected data on card payment fraud contains additional breakdowns in terms of the fraud types underlying the broader category of issuance of a payment order by the fraudster. Chart 7 shows a more detailed composition of card payment fraud in both value and volume terms for reference period H1 2023 only, which further distinguishes between non-remotely and remotely initiated fraudulent transactions. The theft of card details (e.g. via data breaches, phishing or other social engineering techniques) in H1 2023 accounted for 61% and 64% of remotely initiated card fraud in terms of value and volumes, respectively.9 Counterfeit card fraud accounted for 9% of remote card fraud in value and for 12% in volume terms. Other types of remote issuance of a payment order by the fraudster accounted for 18% of remote card fraud in value and for 15% in volume terms. As mentioned above, only a low share of card fraud was due to the manipulation of the payer to initiate a payment, accounting for 7% in value and 1% in volume terms. A large share of non-remote card payment fraud is conducted using lost or stolen cards. Lost or stolen cards accounted for 39% of the value of non-remote card fraud in H1 2023 and for 53% of the volume of fraudulent, non-remote card payments. In addition, 44% of card fraud in value terms (35% in terms of volumes) in H1 2023 was reported under the category of other types of fraud related to the issuance of a payment order by the fraudster. This includes, for instance, account takeovers and compromised application fraud, where fraudsters apply for a card in someone else’s name or request a replacement card by falsely reporting theft or loss. In the wake of the global rollout and maturity of EMV terminals, non-remote card fraud using counterfeit cards played only a minor role in H1 2023, accounting for 8% of the value of non-remote card fraud (6% in volume terms)."
Fraud,"Whereas most payment transactions were domestic16, most card payment fraud was related to cross-border transactions. The value of domestic credit transfers and card payments accounted for between 79% and 82% of the total value of credit transfers and card payments, respectively, in each of the three reference periods analysed (see Chart 20a); in volume terms, the shares of domestic in total transactions ranged between 95% and 96% for credit transfers and between 82% and 83% for card payments (see Chart 21a). In contrast, more than two-thirds of card fraud was related to crossborder transactions in both value and volume terms (see Charts 20b and 21b). Cross-border card fraud in H1 2023 accounted for 71% of the total value of card fraud and 68% of the total volume of fraudulent transactions using cards issued in the EU/EEA.

In addition, a large share of fraudulent credit transfers and direct debits took place across borders. As regards credit transfers, 43% of the total value of credit transfer fraud and 36% of the volume of fraudulent credit transfers were related to cross-border payments in the first half of 2023. For direct debits, cross-border fraud accounted for around half of total fraud in both value and volume terms. In contrast, the majority of fraudulent cash withdrawals was domestic (87% in value and 74% in volume terms in H1 2023). For e-money transactions domestic transactions accounted for more than twothirds of the total value of fraud, while the share of cross-border fraud appeared higher in volume terms (55% for H1 2023)."
Fraud,"Whereas most payment transactions were domestic16, most card payment fraud was related to cross-border transactions. The value of domestic credit transfers and card payments accounted for between 79% and 82% of the total value of credit transfers and card payments, respectively, in each of the three reference periods analysed (see Chart 20a); in volume terms, the shares of domestic in total transactions ranged between 95% and 96% for credit transfers and between 82% and 83% for card payments (see Chart 21a). In contrast, more than two-thirds of card fraud was related to crossborder transactions in both value and volume terms (see Charts 20b and 21b). Cross-border card fraud in H1 2023 accounted for 71% of the total value of card fraud and 68% of the total volume of fraudulent transactions using cards issued in the EU/EEA. In addition, a large share of fraudulent credit transfers and direct debits took place across borders. As regards credit transfers, 43% of the total value of credit transfer fraud and 36% of the volume of fraudulent credit transfers were related to cross-border payments in the first half of 2023. For direct debits, cross-border fraud accounted for around half of total fraud in both value and volume terms. In contrast, the majority of fraudulent cash withdrawals was domestic (87% in value and 74% in volume terms in H1 2023). For e-money transactions domestic transactions accounted for more than twothirds of the total value of fraud, while the share of cross-border fraud appeared higher in volume terms (55% for H1 2023).

Significant shares of card payment and e-money fraud were related to cross-border transactions with PSPs located outside the EEA. Cross-border transactions outside the EEA accounted for almost 30% of the value of card fraud using cards issued in the EU/EEA in H1 2023, compared with only 4% of the total value of card payments. Similarly, such transactions accounted for more than 20% of e-money fraud in H1 2023 in terms of volumes, in comparison with only 5% of total e-money payments."
Energy,"Geopolitical tensions and fragmentation are major risks for energy security and for coordinated action on reducing emissions Escalating conflict in the Middle East and Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine underscore the continued energy security risks that the world faces. Some of the immediate effects of the global energy crisis had started to recede in 2023, but the risk of further disruptions is now very high. The experience of the last few years shows how quickly dependencies can turn into vulnerabilities; a lesson that applies also to clean energy supply chains that have high levels of market concentration. Markets for traditional fuels and for clean technologies are becoming more fragmented: since 2020, almost 200 trade measures affecting clean energy technologies – most of them restrictive – have been introduced around the world, compared with 40 in the preceding five-year period. Fragility in today’s energy markets is a reminder of the abiding importance of energy security – the foundational and central mission of the International Energy Agency (IEA) – and the ways that more efficient, cleaner energy systems can reduce energy security risks. The increasingly visible impacts of climate change, the momentum behind clean energy transitions, and the characteristics of clean energy technologies are all changing what it means to have secure energy systems. A comprehensive approach to energy security therefore needs to extend beyond traditional fuels to cover the secure transformation of the electricity sector and the resilience of clean energy supply chains. Energy security and climate action are inextricably linked: extreme weather events, intensified by decades of high emissions, are already posing profound energy security risks. Clean energy transitions have accelerated sharply in recent years, shaped by government policies and industrial strategies, but there is more near-term uncertainty than usual over how these policies and strategies will evolve. Countries representing half of global energy demand are holding elections in 2024, and energy and climate issues have been prominent themes for voters that have been buffeted by high fuel and electricity prices, and by floods and heatwaves. Yet energy policies and climate targets, influential though they are, are not the only forces behind the continued rise of clean energy. There are strong cost drivers, as well as intense competition for leadership in clean energy sectors that are major sources of innovation, economic growth and employment. More than ever, the energy outlook is complex, multifaceted and defies a single view on how the future might unfold.

Robust, independent analysis and data-driven insights are vital to navigate today’s energy uncertainties Reflecting today’s uncertainties, our three main scenarios are complemented by sensitivity cases for renewables, electric mobility, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and how heatwaves, efficiency policies and the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) might affect electricity demand. The scenarios and sensitivity cases illustrate different pathways that the energy sector could follow, the levers that decision-makers can use to reach them, and their implications for energy markets, security and emissions, and for people’s lives and livelihoods. The Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) provides a sense of the energy sector’s direction of travel today, based on the latest market data, technology costs and in-depth analysis of the prevailing policy settings in countries around the world. The STEPS also provides the backdrop for the upside and downside sensitivity cases. The Announced Pledges Scenario (APS) examines what would happen if all national energy and climate targets made by governments, including net zero goals, are met in full and on time. The Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) Scenario maps out an increasingly narrow path to reach net zero emissions by mid-century in a way that limits global warming to 1.5 °C.

Geopolitical risks abound but underlying market balances are easing, setting the stage for intense competition between different fuels and technologies The next phase in the journey to a safer and more sustainable energy system is set to take place in a new energy market context, marked by continued geopolitical hazards but also by relatively abundant supply of multiple fuels and technologies. Our detailed analysis of market balances and supply chains brings an overhang of oil and LNG supply into view during the second half of the 2020s, alongside a large surfeit of manufacturing capacity for some key clean energy technologies, notably for solar PV and batteries. These provide something of a buffer against further market disruptions, but also imply downward pressure on prices and a period of increased competition among suppliers. The rapid rise in clean energy deployment in recent years came during a period of price volatility for fossil fuels. Clean technology costs are coming down, but maintaining and accelerating momentum behind their deployment in a lower fuel-price world is a different proposition. How consumer choices and government policies play out will have huge consequences for the future of the energy sector, and for tackling climate change.

How fast will clean energy transitions unfold? Clean energy is entering the energy system at an unprecedented rate, including more than 560 gigawatts (GW) of new renewables capacity added in 2023, but deployment is far from uniform across technologies and countries. Investment flows to clean energy projects are approaching USD 2 trillion each year, almost double the combined amount spent on new oil, gas and coal supply – and costs for most clean technologies are resuming a downward trend after rising in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic. This helps renewable power generation capacity rise from 4 250 GW today to nearly 10 000 GW in 2030 in the STEPS, short of the tripling target set at COP28 but more than enough, in aggregate, to cover the growth in global electricity demand, and to push coal-fired generation into decline. Together with nuclear power, which is the subject of renewed interest in many countries, lowemissions sources are set to generate more than half of the world’s electricity before 2030. China stands out: it accounted for 60% of the new renewable capacity added worldwide in 2023 – and China’s solar PV generation alone is on course to exceed, by the early 2030s, the total electricity demand of the United States today. There are open questions, in China and elsewhere, about how quickly and efficiently new renewable capacity can be integrated into power systems, and whether grid expansions and permitting times keep pace. Policy uncertainty and a high cost of capital are holding back clean energy projects in many developing economies. Recent clean energy trends in advanced economies present a mixed picture, with accelerations in some areas accompanied by slowdowns in others, including a large fall in heat pump sales in Europe in the first half of 2024. Progress on the other headline commitments from COP28 is lagging: the goal of doubling the global rate of energy efficiency improvements could provide larger emissions reductions by 2030 than anything else, but looks far out of reach under today’s policy settings. Tried and tested policies and technologies are likewise available to deliver a major reduction in methane emissions from fossil fuel operations, but abatement efforts have been patchy and uneven.

Clean energy momentum remains strong enough to bring a peak in demand for each of the fossil fuels by 2030 Demand for energy services is rising rapidly, led by emerging and developing economies, but the continued progress of transitions means that, by the end of the decade, the global economy can continue to grow without using additional amounts of oil, natural gas or coal. This has not been the case in recent years: despite record clean energy deployment, twothirds of the increase in global energy demand in 2023 was met by fossil fuels, pushing energy-related CO2 emissions to another record high. In the STEPS, the largest sources of rising demand for energy are, in descending order, India, Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa. But growth in clean energy and structural changes in the global economy, particularly in China, are starting to temper overall energy demand growth, not least because a more electrified, renewables-rich system is inherently more efficient than one dominated by fossil fuel combustion (in which a lot of the energy generated is lost as waste heat). Outcomes in individual years can vary in practice depending on broader economic or weather conditions, or in hydropower output, but the direction of travel under today’s policy settings is clear. Continued growth in global energy demand post-2030 can be met solely with clean energy. The world has the need and the capacity to go much faster Ample clean energy manufacturing capacity creates scope for faster transitions that move towards alignment with national and global net zero goals, but this means addressing imbalances in today’s investment flows and clean energy supply chains. Over the past five years, annual solar capacity additions quadrupled to 425 GW, but annual manufacturing capacity is set for a sixfold increase to more than 1 100 GW, a level that – if deployed in full – would be very close to the amounts needed in the NZE Scenario. There is a similar story of plentiful manufacturing capacity for lithium-ion batteries. Bringing these technologies at scale to developing economies would be transformative for the global outlook, helping rising demand to be met in a sustainable way and allowing global emissions not only to peak in the coming years, as they do in the STEPS, but also to enter a meaningful decline, which they do not do in the STEPS. This requires concerted efforts to facilitate investment in developing economies by addressing risks that push up the cost of capital. Periods of ample supply make life difficult for new entrants, but improving the resilience and diversity of the supply chains for clean energy technologies and for critical minerals remains an essential task. For the moment, these supply chains are heavily concentrated in China.

Demand for electricity is taking off, but how high will it go? The contours of a new, more electrified energy system are coming into focus as global electricity demand soars. Electricity use has grown at twice the pace of overall energy demand over the last decade, with two-thirds of the global increase in electricity demand over the last ten years coming from China. Electricity demand growth is set to accelerate further in the years ahead, adding the equivalent of Japanese demand to global electricity use each year in the STEPS, and rising even more quickly in scenarios that meet national and global net zero goals. The projections for global electricity demand in STEPS are 6%, or 2 200 terawatt-hours (TWh), higher in 2035 than in last year’s Outlook, driven by light industrial consumption, electric mobility, cooling, and data centres and AI. Rising data centre electricity use, linked in part to growing use of AI, is already having some strong local impacts, but the potential implications of AI for energy are broader and include improved systems coordination in the power sector and shorter innovation cycles. There are more than 11 000 data centres registered worldwide and they are often spatially concentrated, so local effects on electricity markets can be substantial. However, at a global level, data centres account for a relatively small share of overall electricity demand growth to 2030. More frequent and intense heatwaves than we assume in the STEPS, or higher performance standards applied to new appliances – notably air conditioners – both produce significantly greater variations in projected electricity demand than an upside case for data centres. The combination of rising incomes and increasing global temperatures generate more than 1 200 TWh of extra global demand for cooling by 2035 in the STEPS, an amount greater than the entire Middle East’s electricity use today."
Energy,"The rise of electric mobility, led by China, is wrong-footing oil producers The slowdown in oil demand growth in the STEPS puts major resource owners in a bind as they face a significant overhang of supply. China has been the engine of oil market growth in recent decades, but that engine is now switching over to electricity: the country’s oil use for road transport is projected to decline in the STEPS, although offset by a large increase in oil use as a petrochemical feedstock. India becomes the main source of oil demand growth, adding almost 2 million barrels per day (mb/d) to 2035. Cost-competitive EVs – many of them from Chinese manufacturers – are making inroads in a range of markets, although there is uncertainty over how fast their share will grow. EVs currently have a share of around 20% in new car sales worldwide, and this rises towards 50% by 2030 in the STEPS (a level already being achieved in China this year), by which time EVs displace around 6 mb/d of oil demand. If the market share of electric cars were to rise more slowly, remaining below 40% by the end of the decade, this would add 1.2 mb/d to projected oil demand in 2030, but there would still be a visible flattening in the global trajectory. Additional near-term oil supply is coming mainly from the Americas – the United States, Brazil, Guyana and Canada – and this is putting pressure on the market management strategies of the OPEC+ grouping. The STEPS sees prices around USD 75-80 per barrel, but this implies further production restraint and an increase in spare capacity, which is already at record levels of around 6 mb/d.

Who will ride the wave of new LNG? An increase of nearly 50% in global LNG export capacity is on the horizon, led by the United States and Qatar, but the prices that many suppliers need to recover their investments may not entice developing economies to switch to natural gas at scale: something has to give. Around 270 billion cubic metres (bcm) of annualised new LNG capacity has been approved and, if delivered according to announced schedules, is set to enter into operation over the period to 2030, a huge addition to global supply. In the STEPS, LNG demand grows by more than 2.5% per year to 2035, an upward revision from last year’s outlook and faster than the rise in overall gas demand. Europe and China have the import infrastructure to absorb significantly more gas, but their scope to clear the market is constrained by their investments in clean energy. Gas-importing emerging and developing economies would generally need prices at around USD 3-5/MBtu to make gas attractive as a large-scale alternative to renewables and coal, but delivered costs for most new export projects need to average around USD 8/MBtu to cover their investments and operation. If gas markets are to absorb all the prospective new LNG supply and to continue to grow past 2030, this would require some combination of even lower clearing prices, higher electricity demand and slower energy transitions – with less wind and solar, lower rates of building efficiency improvements, and fewer heat pumps – than projected in the STEPS. However, any acceleration of global energy transitions towards the outcomes projected in the APS or NZE Scenario, or a wild card for supply like a large new Russia-China gas supply deal (which we do not include in the STEPS), would exacerbate the LNG glut.

Lower fuel prices ease concerns about affordability and industrial competitiveness in fuel-importing economies The new market context may provide some breathing space for fuel-importing countries and regions – such as Europe, and South and Southeast Asia – that have been hit hard by higher prices for fossil fuels and electricity in recent years. Consumers around the world spent nearly USD 10 trillion on energy in 2022 during the global energy crisis, around half of which ended up as record revenues for oil and gas producers. An easing of price levels promises some welcome relief, particularly in fuel-importing countries. Lower natural gas prices should lift some of Europe’s gloom about its industrial competitiveness, although Europe still faces a sizeable structural energy price disadvantage compared with the United States and China. The breathing space from fuel price pressures can provide policymakers with room to focus on stepping up investment in renewables, grids, storage and efficiency; facilitating the removal of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies; and allowing developing economies to regain the momentum that was lost in recent years behind the provision of access to electricity and clean cooking fuels. However, cheaper natural gas can also slow structural changes by diminishing the economic case for consumers to switch to cleaner technologies, and by making it more difficult to close the cost gap with alternatives like biomethane and low-emissions hydrogen.

A sustainable energy system needs to be people-centred and resilient A new energy system needs to be built to last: this means prioritising security, resilience and flexibility, and ensuring that the benefits of the new energy economy are shared. The STEPS does not see traditional energy security concerns diminishing, particularly for importers in Asia that face a long-term rise in their dependence on oil and gas imports to nearly 90% for oil and around 60% for gas by 2050. At the same time, faster clean energy transitions put the spotlight on electricity security, as growing electricity demand and more variable generation increase the operational need for flexibility in power systems, both for short-term and seasonal needs. This also requires a rebalancing of power sector investment towards grids and battery storage, as proposed by the IEA in advance of the COP291 climate conference in Baku, Azerbaijan. At the moment, for every dollar spent on renewable power, 60 cents are spent on grids and storage. By the 2040s, this reaches parity in all scenarios. Many power systems are vulnerable to an increase in extreme weather events and cyberattacks, putting a premium on adequate investments in resilience and digital security. Dividing lines are emerging on energy and climate, which can only be bridged if there is more help provided to poorer countries, communities and households to manage the upfront costs of change, including much greater international support. High financing costs and project risks are limiting the spread of cost-competitive clean energy technologies to where they are needed most, especially in developing economies where they can deliver the biggest returns for sustainable development and affordability. Lack of access to modern energy is the most fundamental inequity in today’s energy system, with 750 million people – predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa – remaining without access to electricity and more than 2 billion without clean cooking fuels. The outlook for access projects is improving thanks to cheaper technologies, new policies, the growing availability of digital payment options and pay-as-you-go business models, but more is needed, including a stronger focus on electrifying productive uses, which can improve project bankability. The climate finance discussions at COP29 and at the G20 will be a barometer of the prospects for scaling up clean energy investment in developing economies, which will also require strengthened national policy visions, policies and institutions, and a willingness to engage with the private sector.

Choices and consequences Despite gathering momentum behind transitions, the world is still a long way from a trajectory aligned with its climate goals. Decisions by governments, investors and consumers too often entrench the flaws in today’s energy system, rather than pushing it towards a cleaner and safer path. There are some positive developments in the STEPS, but today’s policy settings still put the world on course for a rise of 2.4 °C in global average temperatures by 2100, entailing ever more severe risks from a changing climate. Our scenario analysis highlights the prospect of buyers and consumers having the edge in energy markets for a time, with suppliers competing for their attention as they make fuel and technology choices that have widely different implications for the energy sector and for its emissions. All parties need to recognise that locking in fossil fuel use has consequences. There may be downward pressure on fuel prices for a while, but energy history tells us that one day the cycle will be reversed, and prices will rise. And the costs of climate inaction, meanwhile, grow higher by the day as emissions accumulate in the atmosphere and extreme weather imposes its own unpredictable price. By contrast, clean technologies that are increasingly cost-effective today are set to remain so, with greatly reduced exposure to the vagaries of commodity markets and lasting benefits for people and planet."
Energy,"• There are three overarching and inter-related themes for this year’s Outlook. The first is energy security, corresponding to the longstanding core of the IEA’s mandate as well as the imperatives of the present given escalating risks in the Middle East. The second relates to the prospects for clean energy transitions, which have accelerated rapidly in recent years, but which need to move much faster to meet climate goals. A third theme is uncertainty, an ever-present factor in any forward-looking analysis but particularly visible this year: our Outlook includes several sensitivity cases on key factors affecting oil, gas and electricity demand in the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS). • The potential for near-term disruption to oil and gas supply is high due to conflict in the Middle East. Around 20% of today’s global oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG) supplies flow through the Strait of Hormuz, a maritime chokepoint in the region. However, while geopolitical risks remain elevated, an easing in underlying market balances and prices is on the horizon as slowing oil demand growth in the STEPS sees spare crude oil production capacity rise to 8 million barrels per day by 2030. A wave of new LNG projects is set to add almost 50% to available export capacity by 2030. • In all our scenarios, growth in global energy demand slows thanks to efficiency gains, electrification and a rapid buildout of renewables. In the STEPS by 2030, nearly every other car sold in the world is electric, although delays in the roll-out of charging infrastructure or in policy implementation could lead to slower growth. • Clean energy meets virtually all growth in energy demand in aggregate in the STEPS between 2023 and 2035, leading to an overall peak in demand for all three fossil fuels before 2030, although trends vary widely across countries at different stages of economic and energy development. • Electricity demand grows much faster than overall energy demand, thanks to existing uses, notably cooling, and new ones such as electric mobility and data centres. Renewables lead the expansion in electricity generation, with sufficient speed to meet in aggregate all the increases in demand. There is scope to go even faster: today’s solar manufacturing capacity hovers around 1 100 GW per year, potentially allowing for deployment almost three-times higher than in 2023. • The share of clean energy investment in emerging market and developing economies outside of China remains stuck at 15% of the total, even though these economies account for two-thirds of the global population and one-third of global GDP. A range of new business models and a policy push in some countries ensure that an additional 550 million people gain access to clean cooking and nearly 200 million to electricity in the STEPS between 2023 and 2030. This still falls well short of universal access goals."
Energy,"How fast might demand for electricity increase? The global energy economy is increasingly electrifying. Since 2010, electricity demand has increased on average by 2.7% per year, while overall energy demand has risen by 1.4% per year. Electricity is increasingly being used in place of fossil fuels to provide heat, mobility and industrial energy demand. Innovations such as smart grids and advances in the efficiency of electric motors and appliances have also boosted the appeal of electricity. The share of electricity in total final consumption rises more rapidly than in the past in all three scenarios and across nearly all regions. This trend is a consequence of increased electrification in households and commercial buildings as well as in transport and industry. Most of this demand growth is from emerging market and developing economies. China dominates, but other countries make a significant contribution, especially after 2030. However, the pace of demand growth – and the uncertainties surrounding it – also pose challenges for ensuring a secure, affordable and sustainable electricity supply.

Emerging market and developing economies lead demand growth in the STEPS In the STEPS, global electricity demand nearly doubles by 2050, rising to 50 000 TWh from 26 000 TWh in 2023. From 2023 to 2035 alone, growth averages nearly 1 000 TWh per year, equivalent to adding another Japan to global electricity consumption each year. Trends vary by sector. The transport sector has the lowest current rate of electrification in final consumption, but it also sees the fastest rate of projected demand growth as EVs account for a rising share of vehicle sales (section 1.3). Increased space cooling and appliance ownership drive electricity demand growth in the buildings sector, underpinned by economic expansion. Electrification in industry is also a significant factor. Emerging market and developing economies are projected to contribute nearly 80% of growth in electricity demand to 2030 in the STEPS, with China alone making up over 45% of the global growth total (Figure 1.10). China’s energy sector has electrified particularly fast, with electricity rising from 11% of final consumption in 2000 to 26% in 2023: a major cause was surging electricity use in the buildings sector, with growing incomes leading to rapid increases in appliances and demand for space cooling, while space heating has also increasingly been electrified. China’s demand rises further in the coming decades, with the rapid uptake of EVs being a key driver. The story in India is similar, though starting from a lower base: the share of electricity in final consumption rose in India from 11% in 2000 to 18% in 2023, and half of the electricity demand growth to 2050 is projected in the STEPS to come in the buildings sector. After a period of slower growth, trends in advanced economies are changing. In the United States, the share of electricity in final consumption was static from 2010 to 2023 at under 22%, but it rises to nearly 40% by 2050 in the STEPS, with an expanding EV fleet accounting for 65% of overall demand growth. After falling in recent years, electricity demand in the IEA. CC BY 4.0. 40 International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024 European Union is also shifting back to growth, and the share of electricity in final consumption today more than doubles to 45% in 2050 in the STEPS. Rising demand from EVs is again one of the main causes, along with more electrification of space heating in the buildings sector"
Energy,"Is clean power generation growing fast enough? Rapidly scaling up low-emissions sources of electricity is a central part of any clean energy transition. While the electricity sector is the largest emitting energy sector today, a lot of action is in hand to reduce those emissions, driven by national and international commitments. For renewables, ambitious collective goals were set at COP28, including to triple global installed capacity of renewable energy by 2030, while over 150 countries have policies to expand the use of renewablesin the power sector. For nuclear power, an initiative was established in December 2023 that targets a tripling of global nuclear capacity by 2050, and more than 30 countries have plans to expand their use of nuclear energy. There are additional initiatives to accelerate less mature technologies including carbon capture and low-emissions hydrogen. All the actions taking place are vital to efforts to decarbonise electricity and achieve the COP28 goal of transitioning away from fossil fuels in line with net zero emissions by 2050. Many clean energy technologies are already mature. Solar PV and wind are now the cheapest electricity sources in most markets, and hydropower and bioenergy are well-established contributors. A new generation of large-scale nuclear reactors is being built in several countries with enhanced features, and small modular reactors are under development. In addition, the importance of a systems approach – including the need to expand and modernise electricity grids and accelerate the uptake of energy storage and demand response – is increasingly recognised as essential to deliver the most affordable and secure transitions (IEA, 2024c)."
Climate,"Climate hazards and disasters are increasing and devastating communities worldwide The year 2024 is on track to set new records for global warming with unprecedented national temperature levels. For the twelfth consecutive month, the global average temperature was 1.5°C warmer than the pre-industrial era. By August 2024, 15 national temperature heat records were broken across the world. Increasing temperatures, coupled with increasingly variable precipitation patterns, have had dramatic effects across the world. For example, Southern Africa experienced its driest February in a century, while the United Kingdom experienced its second-wettest period in the past two centuries. The People’s Republic of China witnessed a record number of significant floods, and the hottest July since 1961. Flooding in central Europe was unprecedented, a one in a 300-hundred-year event in terms of the extent of damages. Wildfires in Canada in 2024 have been devastating. These extreme weather events have destroyed lives and livelihoods with economic losses and damages yet to be fully assessed. These dramatic events are confirmed by OECD data tracking climate-related hazards. Over 42% of the population in 50 countries and the EU covered under IPAC experienced at least 2 weeks of extreme temperatures in 2023. Of these, in 21 countries, the population exposed to tropical nights over 2019-23 increased by 10% compared to 1981-2010. The temperatures recorded in 2024 further highlight this trend, which not only has direct impacts but can also intensify hazards such as hurricanes, heatwaves, droughts and extreme rainfall. This, in turn, can affect vulnerable populations, ecosystems and infrastructure. Changing temperatures and precipitation patterns disproportionately affect vulnerable countries, exacerbating the impacts of extreme weather events and further deepening social and economic inequalities. Agricultural drought conditions and extreme precipitation events are intensifying. OECD data on average soil moisture continues to fall in most countries over the period 2019-2023. These drought conditions can be particularly acute at the subnational level and during specific seasons, generating major social and economic consequences. This situation is aggravated by altered rainfall patterns. Over 18% of the population of countries covered under IPAC is exposed to the risk of river flooding. This risk can be as high as 40% for some countries. Similarly, more than 2.6% of the population in these countries is exposed to the risk of coastal flooding. Triggering climate tipping points risks disrupting the climate on a global scale, creating a planetary emergency. Tipping points, such as the disintegration of ice sheets and the weakening of ocean currents, may already be underway and the risk of crossing more climate tipping points increases considerably at 1.5°C, potentially leading to catastrophic impacts on the climate. Meltwater from ice-sheet collapse, for example, contributes to a slowdown of the ocean currents, which in turn may contribute to impacts in other ecosystems, highlighting the interconnectedness of these major environmental changes. Immediate action to limit global warming to 1.5°C is essential to prevent cascading effects of climate tipping points that could lead to a planetary emergency.

"
Climate,"GHG emission reduction commitments are not consistent with the Paris Agreement temperature goals. More ambition and efforts are needed to achieve net zero by 2050 The Paris Agreement has been crucial in strengthening climate action, but a significant ambition gap remains. By August 2024, 195 Parties have communicated their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). However, emission reduction targets in the current set of NDCs are insufficient to achieve the Paris Agreement temperature goals. Even if current NDCs (considering unconditional targets) are fully implemented, estimated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are projected to reach 55 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents (Gt CO2e) in 2030. This reveals an ambition gap of around 22 Gt CO2e to limit global warming to 1.5°C estimated to be consistent with global GHG emissions of 33 Gt CO2e. Furthermore, the current net-zero targets are not ambitious enough. By August 2024, 110 Parties, covering 88% of global GHG emissions, have pledged net-zero targets. However, even if all these netzero targets are met, total emissions are estimated to reach 21 Gt CO2e in 2050. This will exceed considerably the 8 Gt CO2e level estimated to be necessary to limit global warming to 1.5°C. In addition, the lack of legally binding net-zero targets in most countries poses a risk that these commitments may not be fully achieved. Only 27 countries and the European Union, representing 16% of global GHG emissions, have legally enshrined their net-zero targets. Global emissions continued to grow in 2023. Global GHG emissions (including land-use, land-use change and forestry) increased by 1.3% between 2022 and 2023. This implies that current global emissions need to decrease by 2030 by 43% to achieve the 1.5°C and 27% to reach the 2°C temperature goals. Given that countries are soon to submit the next round of NDCs for 2035 and Biennial Transparency Reports, it is critical that they address both the ambition and implementation gaps. Updated NDCs should be aligned with the 1.5°C considering economy-wide targets; and long-term legally binding GHG emission reduction targets will be critical for achieving the Paris Agreement goals."
Climate,"Progress in national climate policy efforts remains insufficient. Policy implementation needs to be scaled-up. The 2% expansion of government climate mitigation policy action in 2023 is not sufficient to meet countries’ NDCs, indicating the existence of an implementation gap. The Climate Actions and Policies Measurement Framework (CAPMF) measures climate policy action by governments both in terms of policy density (i.e. the number of policies in place in a country) and stringency (i.e. the degree to which climate policies incentivise or enable GHG emissions mitigation). It is a climate mitigation policy database centred on a structured policy typology that tracks a common set of policies with harmonised policy attributes on an annual basis. It covers all OECD and partner countries except the USA. Over the last decade, climate policy action for the countries covered by the CAPMF expanded, on average, by 10% annually. However, in 2022 and 2023 climate policy action only expanded by 1% and 2% respectively. Although the CAPMF does not measure effectiveness directly, it is an indicator of policy effort. The observed slow expansion in climate policy action poses a risk of countries failing to achieve their NDCs. In fact, recent evidence from UNEP confirms that current climate policy action is not strong enough to realise the emission reduction targets set out in countries’ NDCs. The slow progress in climate policy action is underpinned by diverse policy developments across sectors and types of policy instruments. The expansion, albeit limited, was primarily driven by strengthening existing policies rather than by adopting new ones, highlighting the importance of recognising countries’ efforts to increase policy stringency. Climate policy action concentrating on nonmarket-based policy instruments expanded thanks to strengthened regulations such as minimum energy performance standards. Policies related to setting targets, governance, the provision of climate data and international co-operation increased slightly after having grown significantly with the adoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015. However, policies implemented through market-based instruments declined, mainly due to reduced subsidies for renewable energy.

The gap in national climate policy action between OECD and partner countries continued to widen in 2023. While climate mitigation policy action expanded in both OECD and OECD partner countries, the gap in climate policy density and stringency between the two groups increased by 2%. Diverging climate policy action, especially stringency, affects competitiveness and may trigger carbon leakage, reinforcing the need for more international co-operation on climate policy action. There is no one size fits all policy approach and no single recipe for their effectiveness. A policy mix results from a complex interaction between past climate action, climate ambitions, emissions profiles and available technologies as well as countries’ cultural, social, political and institutional conditions. Differences in climate policy action between OECD and partner countries is mostly driven by differences in policy density rather than policy stringency. OECD countries generally use more complex mix of policies to reduce emissions and strengthened their stringency. OECD partner countries have less stringent policies, though some countries reach stringency levels of OECD countries. The CAPMF data illustrates that some countries prefer to adopt relatively few, albeit stringent, policies. Conversely, others prefer to adopt many policies with rather low stringency. Some sector-specific climate policy action has picked up in 2023. This was driven by increased policy action in the transport, building and industry sectors. In contrast, climate policy action in the electricity sector decreased, primarily due to fewer renewable energy auctions. The latter was accompanied by a rise of electricity-related emissions. Climate policy action is misaligned with sectoral emissions profiles. Descriptive analysis from the CAPMF suggests that climate policy action may not be well-aligned across emission source sectors. For example, although transport accounts for the highest share of energy-related emissions in OECD countries, climate action is second to lowest. Similarly, in OECD partner countries, climate policy action in the electricity sector is the lowest, yet this sector accounts for the largest share of emissions. Although there are many other considerations, such as effectiveness, equity and costs, these, albeit indicative, results would suggest that there are possible avenues for more effective climate action by better aligning climate policy with emission sources. To address climate-related hazards, countries are increasingly developing national adaptation strategies. There is significant progress in the number of countries submitting National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) and National Adaptation Communications to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). However, it is still unclear whether these plans are underpinned by concrete policy actions and robust monitoring frameworks. More work is necessary to consistently track adaptation policies to support stakeholder engagement, promote peer learning and raise the efficacy of adaptation initiatives."
Climate,"How far are countries from achieving national and global mitigation objectives?

The Paris Agreement has been instrumental in advancing global efforts to address climate change. The Agreement aims to limit global warming well below 2ºC by the end of the century and to “pursue efforts to limit temperature increase to 1.5°C” (UNFCCC, 2015[1]). To achieve this objective, countries or Parties to the Agreement commit to progressively reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). As of August 2024, 195 Parties had communicated their NDCs with 110 Parties (109 countries and the European Union) pledging to achieve net-zero emissions, and 96 aiming for this target by 2050. Current commitments are not ambitious enough to meet the Paris Agreement temperature goals. Global GHG emissions must be limited to 33 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (Gt CO2e) by 2030 to limit global warming to 1.5°C and 41 Gt CO2e to limit global warming to 2°C. However, global emissions are projected to reach 57 Gt CO2e by 2030 based on policies implemented as of 2024 (UNEP, 2024[2]). Moreover, even if countries fulfil their unconditional 2030 commitments, GHG emissions are estimated to increase to at least 55 Gt CO2e in 2030. Similarly, global GHG emissions must be limited to 8 Gt CO2e by 2050, yet the collective net-zero commitments would lead to at least 21 Gt CO2e by that date. Countries must increase their ambitions significantly and ensure the effectiveness of their policy effort. Estimates of GHG emissions indicate a potential average temperature rise of 1.7 to 1.9°C by the end of the century under the most optimistic scenario (UNEP, 2024[2]). Such a scenario assumes the full implementation of current NDCs and net-zero commitments for both unconditional and conditional pledges.

Global GHG emissions increased in 2022 and 2023 Preliminary estimates suggest that global GHG emissions (including LULUCF) increased by 1.3% between 2022 and 2023 (UNEP, 2024[2]). In 2022, global GHG emissions, including emissions from international aviation and maritime sources and land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF),1 reached 55 Gt CO2e. This represents a 0.3% increase from 2021 and a rise of around 9% compared to 2010. Since their peak in 2005, GHG emissions in OECD countries have gradually declined, falling by 1.2% between 2021-22 and by 11% between 2010-22. They reached an estimated 13 Gt CO2e in 2022. However, emissions from OECD partner countries have continued to rise, increasing by over 35% since 2010 and by 2% since 2021 (Figure 1.1).

Between 2021 and 2022, GHG emissions (including LULUCF) from major OECD emitters such as the United States, the European Union and Japan decreased by 1.7%, 2.5% and 2.1%, respectively, indicating a continued downward trend, although this was partially affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. 2 Similarly, large non-OECD countries, like Brazil and South Africa, experienced reductions in emissions by 0.9% and 3%, respectively. However, emissions increased in 22 countries during this period3 with a concerning surge in large-emitting countries such as Indonesia and India, which experienced increases of 12.4% and 5.1%, respectively (IPAC Dashboard).

GHG emission reduction commitments are not consistent with the Paris Agreement temperature goals NDC targets are not ambitious enough Ambitious mitigation commitments and their effective implementation are essential for meeting the Paris Agreement temperature goals. GHG emission pathways consistent with these goals would require reducing current emissions (55 Gt CO2e) by at least 40% to limit global warming to 1.5 °C and by 36% to achieve the 2°C goal (Figure 1.2). Moreover, as recent estimates suggest, global GHG emissions rose by 1.3% between 2022 and 2023, which implies that current global emissions need to be decreased by a bigger extent by 2030 to achieve the 1.5 and 2°C temperature goals respectively (UNEP, 2024[2]).  15 THE CLIMATE ACTION MONITOR 2024 © OECD 2024 In 2022, OECD and OECD partner countries covered by IPAC collectively accounted for around 80% of global GHG emissions, making their emission reductions a significant indicator of global climate policy action. 4 However, as of August 2024, the unconditional NDCs of OECD and OECD partner countries are projected to result in a reduction of just 4 Gt CO2e by 2030 compared to 2022 levels. This represents an overall commitment to reduce aggregate emissions by 14% by 20305 with OECD countries aiming for a 29% reduction and OECD partner countries only a 5.7% reduction. 6 These GHG emission targets set by OECD and partner countries are not ambitious enough to achieve the Paris Agreement temperature goals. Even if these targets are met, global GHG emissions are projected to remain around 55 Gt CO2e in 2030, well above the 33 Gt CO2e level required for 1.5°C and the 41 Gt CO2e emissions necessary for the 2°C goal. This highlights the significant ambition gap between current commitments and the emission reductions necessary to achieve the Paris Agreement temperature goals.

Climate,"How are climate-related hazards and disasters affecting the world?

In 2024, the world once again witnessed the dramatic consequences of climate change – from record-high temperatures, storms and unprecedented rainfall to droughts, wildfires, and other intense and unexpected climate-related hazards. These impacts continue to pose serious threats to ecosystems and communities worldwide. Extreme weather events are becoming the norm, leading to significant damages and loss of life. These effects can manifest as slow onset events (such as gradual sea-level rise) or sudden extreme events (such as flash floods or intense storms) (IPCC, 2022[1]). Between 2021 and 2023, annual economic losses due to climate-related disasters were estimated at USD 250-280 billion (Munich RE, 2024[2]; 2023[3]; 2022[4]), 1 while around 24 000 lives were lost globally as a result of these disasters (CRED, 2024[5]). The dramatic extreme weather events changes observed in 2024 are isolated events but consistent with long-term trends that can only be understood by tracking hazards and disasters over decades. Drawing on global Earth Observation and other geospatial data sources, the International Programme for Action on Climate (IPAC) has developed indicators for a variety of climate-related hazards. The indicators focus on seven key climate hazards and four exposure domains, providing a time series that goes back as far as 44 years for all countries globally (Maes et al., 2022[6]). This chapter explores the impacts and risks of climate change using historical observation data and introduces some key underlying data on future climate-related hazards. It shows how climate-related hazard exposures can vary across and within countries due to diverse geography, environment and weather patterns that affect each area in both OECD and OECD partner countries. The indicators follow national and international guidelines and are based on the conceptualisation of climate risk of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). These consider climate-related hazard, exposure and vulnerability as the key dimensions of disaster risk (IPCC, 2022[1]). The indicators have recently been updated and some key results are discussed below. IPAC aims to further enhance this indicator set through forward-looking indicators for three key climate hazards and two exposure domains to 2100 (Box 2.1). Assessing future exposure of climate-related hazards is increasingly important. If the world continues on its emissions trajectory and does not meet the Paris Agreement temperature goals, estimates suggest that global gross domestic product (GDP) could fall by 7-10% by 2050 (Swiss Re, 2021[7]). If no action is taken, and temperatures continue to rise to 3.2°C by 2050, global GDP could drop even further – by 18% (Swiss Re, 2021[7]).

Rising extreme temperatures are affecting billions of people worldwide Dangerous temperature levels are increasingly common around the world. IPAC data reveal a significant rise in the number of days with above-average temperatures across all countries (Figure 2.2. On average OECD and OECD partner countries experience an additional 30 days with above-average temperatures). On average, there were an additional 30 days per year with above-average temperatures across OECD and OECD partner countries in 2019-23 compared to 1981-2010. This corroborates recent findings that Earth experienced its warmest day in recent history with global average temperatures peaking at 17.16°C on 22 July 2024 (C3S, 2024[12]).

Changes to extreme heat events involve determining a relative or absolute threshold beyond which conditions are considered extreme. In this analysis, which follows IPCC AR6 (IPCC, 2021[13]) 2 , a hot day exceeds 35°C (Maes et al., 2022[6]), while a tropical night does not go below 20°C. OECD indicators highlight that more and more people are increasingly exposed to extreme heat events. Since 1979, the population in all IPAC countries, both OECD and partner countries, has been increasingly exposed to hot days. 3 An estimated 12% more people in OECD and partner countries were exposed to such conditions in 2019-23 compared to the reference period 1981-2010 (Figure 2.3).

Countries whose population was most exposed to hot days (more than 2 weeks) in 2019-23 comprise Saudi Arabia (96.5%), India (89.3%), Spain (35.4%) and Israel (32.4%), an estimated 1.5 billion people in total. Although historical exposure to extreme temperatures in countries such as Saudi Arabia and Israel was already notably high, exposure is lasting longer. Reports on the ground corroborate OECD indicators, indicating 15 broken national heat records and an additional 130 monthly national temperature records shattered in the first half of 2024 (The Guardian, 2024[14]). For example, New Delhi experienced more than 40 days with temperatures above 40°C between May and June 2024, with one part of Delhi reaching 49.9°C. To make matters worse, hotter nights deprive people of the time needed to recover from the extreme heat experienced during the day. A report from the Centre for Science and Environment Analysis illustrates how heightened humidity and the urban heat island, driven by climate change, exacerbate heat stress conditions in Delhi (CSE, 2024[15]). Moreover, extreme heat is experienced differently across groups who do not have resources to protect themselves. Low-income people and environment systems are especially vulnerable to extreme heat (Page, 2024[16])."
